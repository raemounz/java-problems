# Factorial

The **factorial** of a positive integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

For instance, `4!` is `24` (that is `1 x 2 x 3 x 4`).

The input is `n` where `n <= 20`.

*NOTE:* The solution consists of 2 methods to compare which one is faster: 

- Using `stream`

- Using `for` loop.
